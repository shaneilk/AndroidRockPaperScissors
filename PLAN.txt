The Plan:

Make an app that allows the play of the game rock paper scissors

Mandatory Features:
- Regular Rock Paper Scissors GamePlay (essentially until you want to stop playing)
       - each game that is won is counted as a win for that player (rather than a group of games)
- Best out of 3, 5, 7
        - essentially playing in series such that each series win counts as a win for that player
        - can play a set amount of games or playing until the heart is content
- Keep Track of for Consequetive Highscores, aka most games won without a loss in between


Special (Optional) Features:
- Design a Special Modification of a game where 1 to 3 more object (depending on how much Shaneil wants) can be made and incorperated into the game
        - ex: lightsaber can be used once every 3 wins and it beats every object besides scissors
- add music and pretty titles and a theme
- dark and light theme
